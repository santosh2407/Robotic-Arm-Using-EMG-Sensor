# Robotic-Arm-Using-EMG-Sensor
- In this project, I have designed a robotic arm which can be controlled with the help of an EMG sensor. The EMG signal is a biomedical signal that measures electrical currents generated in muscles during its contraction representing neuromuscular activities. 
- These EMG signals are being measured from the human body with the help of electrodes connected to the muscle. These detected signals are amplified by employing an amplifier and given to the microcontroller, to which the robotic arm is connected.
